# Football (Soccer) Data Analysis Projects

Apply machine learning/data mining techniques to understand football (soccer).

### Dataset
* [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)
* [Squawka dataset using Squawka scraper](https://github.com/ucdcoc/squawka-scraper) (this tool requires some modifications).

### Projects (Completed)
1. [European Soccer Database Analysis](https://github.com/xzl524/football_data_analysis/tree/master/projects/european_soccer_database_analysis)
	- predicts distributions of number of goals, match results, and match scores with poisson model.
	- applies exploratory data analysis
2. [Football Match Outcome Prediction](https://github.com/xzl524/football_data_analysis/tree/master/projects/match_outcome_prediction)
	- applies supervised learning to football event data for match outcome prediction.
	- tries to answer 2 questions:
		- to what degree can football event data predict match outcome?
		- what event types are most related to match outcome?

### Projects (Ongoing)
To Be Continued.

### Requirements
Python 3.6 (with Tensorflow if neural network model is needed)
